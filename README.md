This is a test app based on the Angular Seed. I will be using it to build a
little Angular JS blog for myself to learn the framework and to experiment.

Played around a little with partials and binding between two services, interesting stuff.

I think I may make a new app for assisting making wargames lists, no persistency and
a very clearly defined objective (I think Angular = optimal for this)

Definitely going to play with Angular on Rails soon (since I know and love Rails!)
